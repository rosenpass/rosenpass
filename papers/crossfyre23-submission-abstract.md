abstract: |
       Rosenpass is a post-quantum-secure key exchange protocol with security against state\\babelhyphen{hard}disruption attacks, whose reference implementation provides post-quantum security to WireGuard deployments. The project's aim is not just to put out a research paper, but to solve the problem of providing a post-quantum VPN top to bottom: from defining a provably secure protocol to educating potential users about how to use it. To achieve this, the project team is composed of an interdisciplinary group of experts in fields inside and outside of cryptography. As such, it is quite different from many purely scientific cryptography projects.

       In this presentation, I would like to share some of the learnings from running the project: how including team-members who are not researchers in the research process led us to better cryptography and how disability inclusion led to a more effective working environment. How feminist organizations shaped our communication style and finally, what funding sources we found to support this project.

       Not all aspects of this project are favorable though; in particular, the extra, unpaid workload needed to coordinate this project has been enormous and the emotional drain from navigating conflicts, uncertain funding, and risk-taking is ever present.

       I still think the community built in the process, the personal growth, the educational benefits and the scientific freedom are well worth the downsides; therefore I would like to exemplify the value in starting collaborations with enthusiastic colleagues from a variety of fields outside cryptographers to the CrossFyre attendees and to encourage other cryptographers to build independent projects for themselves.
