//! Cryptographic key management for cookies and biscuits used in the protocol
//!
//! Cookies in general are conceptually similar to browser cookies;
//! i.e. mechanisms to store information in the party connected to via network.
//!
//! In our case specifically we refer to any mechanisms in the Rosenpass protocol
//! where a peer stores some information in the other party that is cryptographically
//! protected using a temporary, randomly generated key. This file contains the mechanisms
//! used to store the secret keys.
//!
//! We have two cookie-mechanisms in particular:
//!
//! - Rosenpass "biscuits" â€” the mechanism used to make sure the Rosenpass protocol is stateless
//!   with respect to the responder
//! - WireGuard's cookie mechanism to enable proof of IP ownership; Rosenpass has experimental
//!   support for this mechanism
//!
//! The CookieStore type is also used to store cookie secrets sent from the responder to the
//! initiator. This is a bad design and we should separate out this functionality.
//!
//! TODO: CookieStore should not be used for cookie secrets sent from responder to initiator.
//! TODO: Move cookie lifetime management functionality into here
